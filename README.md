# Django-To-do-list

This is another attempt to create a to-do list. This time I am using Django for (previously Flask). 


![alt text](https://github.com/zielonkatom/Django-To-do-list/blob/master/photo1.PNG)

It is possible to:
- add jobs;
- delete all jobs;
- delete one particular job;
- confirm finished job;
- edit job.

Delete and confirm work in a similar way - the only difference is that we get a toast message based on the activity.
